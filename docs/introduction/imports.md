# Imports

If you just want to start scripting right away, importing `shellfish.*` will do the trick; it imports all the extension methods and functionality you need, such as types and functions, to start working right away.

But if you want more consice functionality, the `shellfish.syntax.path.*` and `shellfish.syntax.process.*` will only import the extension methods.

For the static methods, the `shellfish.FilesOs` and `shellfish.ProcessesOs` imports will provide the functions to work with files and processes, if that is your preferred style.

Finally, `shellfish.domain.*` will import all the types needed to work with the library!
